			<h1>L-Systems</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar.
				</p>
				<p>
					L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht.
					Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development.
				</p>
				<p>
					L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.
